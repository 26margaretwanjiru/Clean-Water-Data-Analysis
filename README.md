# CHARTING WATERS: VISUALIZING TRENDS IN WATER DATA ANALYSIS

# 1.0 Introduction
The United Nations Environment Programme (https://www.unep.org/un-2023-water-conference) states that the UN 2023 Water Conference (22-24 March, 2023) saw the adoption of the Water Action Agenda, representing voluntary commitments of nations and stakeholders to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets connected to water.

Furthermore, billions of people worldwide still live without safely managed drinking water and sanitation, even though access to both services has long been defined as a human right. Water, inequalities and the environment are closely linked. A lack of sanitation access is a major cause of water pollution, which in turn is hindering the availability of water for drinking and other essential uses and services.

Water use efficiency has risen by 9 per cent, but water stress and water scarcity remain a concern in many parts of the world. In 2020, 2.4 billion people lived in water-stressed countries. The challenges are compounded by conflicts and climate change, the United Nations further states. Only 0.5 per cent of water on Earth is useable and available freshwater – Wake up to the looming water crisis, report warns by World Meteorological Organization.

The global urban population facing water scarcity is projected to double from 930 million in 2016 to 1.7–2.4 billion people in 2050. Imminent risk of a global water crisis, warns the UN World Water Development Report 2023 by UNESCO.

Sustainable Development Goal 6 is about "clean water and sanitation for all". It is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. According to the United Nations, the goal is to: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."

# 2.0 Data

I took some inspiration from this facts and figures; to analyze water data from by the United Nations SDG 6 Data Portal i.e. (https://sdg6data.org/en/tables) to understand and visualize basic water services, water free of contamination and availability of safe water in schools in African countries.
